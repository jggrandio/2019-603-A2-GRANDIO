# Parallel KNN implementation using CUDA

This repository contains an implementation of the KNN classifier using Parallel programming with CUDA to speed up the process. 

A comparison of the runtime of the single-thread CPU version,
MPI version and GPU parallel version, considering two
different datasets sizes has been carried out to study the improvement achieved.

The insights of the study are shown [here](documentation/KNN_cuda.pdf)
